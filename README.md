Project Title : Capstone Project
Website using maps JavaScrip API
Brief Project Overview
My project is about learning a basic demonstration on how you can use Maps JavaScript API from Google Cloud Platform Marketplace to indicate any place you want and combine it into a website.
Scope of Work
The website demonstrated how Maps JavaScript API is very useful to indicate cities in a map. I used it to indicate  cities where I came from  Guinea, West Africa.
Objectives

Rationale :  I wanted to show the cities where I came from using Maps JavaScript  API.
Objectives
Get it from my repository and clone it to my terminal.                                               
 I created the API key using the maps javascript API.  
Used google maps to get GPS coordinates to find the cities I needed for my project.
 I used Visual Studio Code to  modify the existing code to run mine.
Using google maps I was able to locate the latitude and longitude for the cities. 




Methodology
HTML template (adapted from W3Schools) is very useful especially for people who are learning HTML and JavaScript . This template is very easy to follow for your own project, replace the API with the one you created, and also do  any changes you need to make your project the way you like.
